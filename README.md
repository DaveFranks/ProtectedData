ProtectedData
=============

PowerShell Module for securely encrypting and sharing secret data such as passwords.

This is still in development, and may change drastically before I publish it to PSGet / TechNet.  Any feedback on the user experience and/or review of the security / encryption practices in the code is welcome.
