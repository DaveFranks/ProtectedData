ProtectedData
=============

PowerShell Module for securely encrypting and sharing secret data.

Passwords, other encryption keys, your secret family recipe for baked beans, whatever!  If you don't want to store something in the clear, and need to be able to decrypt the data as more than one user (or on more than one computer), this module can help.

Special thanks to Vadims PodƒÅns ([PowerShell Crypto Guy](http://en-us.sysadmins.lv/default.aspx)), whose feedback, ideas and code contributed greatly to the features that have been added to this module since its v1.0 release - in particular, support for CNG certificates and keys.
